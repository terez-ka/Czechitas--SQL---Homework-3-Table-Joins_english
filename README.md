# Czechitas--SQL---Homework-3-Table-Joins_english
As part of the SQL course, we completed the following task. This task focused on working with aggregation functions, filtering data using conditions (WHERE, LIKE), grouping (GROUP BY), and joining tables (JOIN). We worked with a fictional database in the Oracle system, which we had access to during the course.

Homework Assignment:
1. When were the most units sold, and which product was it?
2. What were the revenues in each state? We are only interested in cities starting with 'Bos'.
3. How many products do manufacturers have in the Mix category? Include also those manufacturers who don't produce anything in this category.
